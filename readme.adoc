# Loom Playground Repository

This repository contains a few selected samples to illustrate behavioral differences between Java Platform Threads and Virtual Threads.

You need at least Java 19 to run these samples and you need Postgres if you want to run the Postgres-based samples. You can use https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/[docker compose] to run the database if you like:

```
$ docker-compose up
...
postgres_1  | 2022-09-27 11:54:59.006 UTC [1] LOG:  listening on Unix socket "/var/run/postgresql/.s.PGSQL.5432"
postgres_1  | 2022-09-27 11:54:59.042 UTC [59] LOG:  database system was shut down at 2022-09-27 11:54:58 UTC
postgres_1  | 2022-09-27 11:54:59.060 UTC [1] LOG:  database system is ready to accept connections
```

There are https://containers.dev/[devcontainers] configuration files provided so you can also use those to install the JDK. Install the https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers[Remote Containers] extension in https://code.visualstudio.com/[VSCode], open the command palette and execute `>Remote-Containers: Reopen in container`, or open the project in https://github.com/codespaces[Codespaces].
